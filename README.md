# Covid19VaxTracker
To run, make sure you have the two csv files in the same folder as main.py. This visualizer shows current US COVID-19 Vaccination data compared to the amount of people who have COVID in each state. Dark green means that there are more people who are vaccinated than have had the virus in the state. This COVID tracker will be updated daily with new information from the CDC website.
